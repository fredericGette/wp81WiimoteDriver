Windows Phone 8.1 driver for Nintendo Wiimote.

**Work in progress**
- No pairing, so after a short time the Wiimote is disconnected by Windows.
- The bluetooth address of the Wiimote is hardcoded in the driver.

Compilation requires Visual Studio 2015 with Windows Phone 8.1 support.

Execution requires Nokia Lumia 520 with Windows Phone 8.1 rooted with [WPinternals](https://github.com/ReneLergner/WPinternals).
